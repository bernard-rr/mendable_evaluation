While a role in a workflow focuses on the tasks and responsibilities within a specific process, a position in an organization is more about the overall structure and hierarchy of the organization. Positions can be assigned tasks, roles, and notifications in the workflow, while roles determine the actions and permissions that a user can take within the workflow. 

In summary, a role in a workflow defines the tasks and responsibilities within a process, while a position in an organization represents a specific user account within the organizational structure."

What is the recommended strategy for managing field states before building any state rules?," We recommend having a strategy to manage field states before building any state rules. You should consider: what state will the object or group occupy for most of its lifecycle, and what exceptions are there for that object in that role and stage combination. It is recommended that initially, all fields should be set to a restricted state such as read-only, disabled or hidden and then overridden for specific stage and role combinations.","The recommended strategy for managing field states before building any state rules is to use the Default state. According to the PerfectApps Help Guide, the Default state should be used to ensure that when the app is opened, a field with a state set to Default should use exactly the same state as it had when the app was last submitted. By default, all PerfectApps fields are set to Normal when a new app instance is created, and these states can be overwritten by the Set State behavior command as well as the field state management itself. Field state management assumes that unless instructed otherwise, the field states should remain as they were. So, by default, Default is selected within field state management."
"What does the term ""operand"" mean in the context of building formulas and conditions?"," An operand is a value or object that is used in a formula or condition. It can be a fixed text or number, a date, the state of a radio button or check box, the value of a field, a special system value, a function, or a mathematical or logical operator.","The term ""operand"" in the context of building formulas and conditions refers to the values or variables that are operated on by an operator. In other words, operands are the inputs or variables that are used in calculations or comparisons. They can be app fields or constants. For example, in the formula ""Total Age = My Age + Spouse's Age"", ""My Age"" and ""Spouse's Age"" are the operands that are being added together using the ""+"" operator. Similarly, in the condition ""If My Age > Spouse's Age"", ""My Age"" and ""Spouse's Age"" are the operands being compared using the "">"" operator."
